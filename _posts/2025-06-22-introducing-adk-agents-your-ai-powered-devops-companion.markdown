# Transform Your Daily Development Workflow with ADK Agents

Ever wished you had a smart colleague who could instantly understand your codebase, help debug issues, automate tedious tasks, and guide you through complex DevOps workflows? **ADK Agents** is that colleague - an AI-powered DevOps assistant built specifically for developers who want to focus on building great software instead of wrestling with tooling.

## 🚀 What Makes ADK Agents Special?

### **Intelligent Codebase Understanding**
ADK Agents doesn't just read your code - it *understands* it. Using advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology, it indexes your entire codebase and can:

- **Instantly explain complex code sections** and their relationships
- **Identify potential issues** before they become problems  
- **Suggest improvements** based on best practices and your project context
- **Navigate large codebases** effortlessly, finding relevant files and functions

```bash
# Just ask - it knows your code better than documentation
$ adk run agents.devops "How does the authentication system work in this project?"

🤖 Analyzing your codebase...
Found authentication implementations in:
- src/auth/jwt_handler.py (JWT token management)
- middleware/auth_middleware.py (Request validation)
- config/security.py (Security configuration)

The system uses JWT tokens with refresh rotation...
```

### **Safe Command Execution with Smart Validation**
Forget about accidentally running destructive commands. ADK Agents features:

- **Intelligent command vetting** - analyzes commands before execution
- **Context-aware suggestions** - proposes the right command for your situation
- **Rollback capabilities** - helps you undo changes when things go wrong
- **Environment awareness** - different behavior for dev/staging/prod

```bash
# It understands intent and suggests safe alternatives
$ adk run agents.devops "I need to reset the database but keep user data"

🤖 I can help you reset the database safely. Instead of a full reset, 
I'll suggest a selective approach:

1. Backup user data: pg_dump --table=users --table=profiles...
2. Drop and recreate non-critical tables
3. Restore user data
4. Update schema versions

Would you like me to proceed with this approach?
```

### **Interactive Planning for Complex Tasks**
No more jumping blindly into complex deployments or refactoring. ADK Agents provides:

- **Step-by-step planning** for multi-part tasks
- **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies
- **Progress tracking** as you work through complex workflows
- **Collaborative refinement** - adjust plans based on your feedback

## 💡 Real Developer Scenarios Where ADK Agents Shines

### **Scenario 1: Debugging Production Issues**
```bash
$ adk run agents.devops "API response times are slow, help me investigate"

🤖 Let me analyze your system. I'll check:
✓ Recent code changes affecting performance
✓ Database query patterns and indexes  
✓ Server metrics and resource usage
✓ External service dependencies

Found: Recent change in user_controller.py added N+1 query...
Suggested fix: Add eager loading for user profiles...
```

### **Scenario 2: Setting Up CI/CD Pipeline**
```bash
$ adk run agents.devops "Set up GitHub Actions for this Python project with testing and deployment"

🤖 I'll create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline:

Plan:
1. Analyze your project structure and dependencies
2. Create workflow for testing (pytest, linting, security scans)
3. Set up staging deployment with approval gates
4. Configure production deployment with rollback
5. Add status badges and notifications

Shall I proceed with this plan?
```

### **Scenario 3: Code Review and Optimization**
```bash
$ adk run agents.devops "Review the recent changes in the payment module"

🤖 Analyzing payment module changes...

✅ Good practices found:
- Proper error handling for payment failures
- Input validation and sanitization

⚠️  Potential improvements:
- Consider adding idempotency keys for payment retries
- Log payment attempts for audit trail
- Add rate limiting for payment endpoints

Would you like me to implement these improvements?
```

## 🎯 Get Started in Minutes

```bash
# Use trunk version with uvx (recommended)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_AI_STUDIO_API_TOKEN
uvx --refresh --from git+https://github.com/BlueCentre/adk-agents.git@main agent run agents.devops.agent

# Install with uv
uv pip install adk-agents

# Or use pip
pip install adk-agents

# Run your first agent
echo "Help me understand this codebase" | uv run agent run agents.devops

# For interactive mode
uv run agent run agents.devops

# For web mode
uv run agent web-packaged --host 0.0.0.0 --session_db_url "sqlite:///sessions.db"
```

### **Minimal Configuration**
Create a simple `.env` file:
```bash
# Basic setup - just add your API key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Advanced users can customize further
GEMINI_THINKING_ENABLE=true
GEMINI_THINKING_INCLUDE_THOUGHTS=true
GEMINI_THINKING_BUDGET=8192
```
